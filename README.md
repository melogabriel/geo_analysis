# Geo Analysis

## Overview
This project provides geospatial and statistical analysis tools using Python. The primary focus is on analyzing advertising and revenue data by city, using t-tests and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations.

## Features
- Upload CSV datasets for analysis
- Perform t-tests to compare cities
- Calculate and visualize ROAS for decision-making
- Prevents division by zero errors in calculations
- Optimized for Google Colab usage

## Installation

Open the notebook in Google Colab:
